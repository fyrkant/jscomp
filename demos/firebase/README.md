This demo aims to show off how the framework handles...

* services
* conditional rendering
* looping over object in template
* asynchronisity

The functionality:

* Clicking a button increases the count for that house.
* Uses a Firebase backend so that counts are common for all users.
* Before any data is loaded it should just show a `Fetching data` message.
