Create a `voter` component tracking the current selection in a `team` state variable. This should be an `int` 0-2. 

The current selection should be given an `active` CSS class.

Write selections to the `JSCOMPVOTE` localStorage key (meaning the selection will be shared across implementations).

Read the selection from localStorage upon creation.
