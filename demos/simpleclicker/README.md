name: Simple Clicker
summary: Super-simple demo showing click handling and state
---

#### Functionality

This is the simplest demo of all, meant to function as a slightly-more-interesting Hello World. It shows a current count and a button to increase that count.


#### Rationale

Demonstrate...

* hello world!
* how to set a click handler
* read/write to state


#### Implementation instruction

* Create a `clicker` component rendered from `bootstrap`.
* Track the `count` state.
* Render the count and the button.
* Initialise the count to 3.

Doing different implementations in the same framework with just small variations is encouraged for this demo.
