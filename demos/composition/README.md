summary: How to do composition
---

This demo shows off...

* how to do component composition
* how components communicate with each other. Both parent to child and child to parent.
* reading values from the DOM
* manipulating the DOM (emptying the field upon submission)


And, what does it do?

* When the field is empty, the button is disabled.
* When the button is clicked the field isn't immediately submitted, instead the user can `confirm` or `cancel`.
