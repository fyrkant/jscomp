#### Where am I?

Welcome! This is a small site with a collection of demos, where each demo has a number of implementations across various JS frameworks. Each demo is focuses on a few particular problems that frameworks need to solve.

The purpose of this is to allow you to **compare JS frameworks** in an easy way. Sort of like [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) but on a much smaller and more accessible scale!

The seed was [this blog post](http://blog.krawaller.se/posts/composition-in-cyclejs-choo-react-and-angular2/) where we compared component composition across a number of frameworks, which we were happy with, but, truth be told it wasn't very accessible.
